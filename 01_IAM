Here is a cheat sheet for the IAM section based on the provided PDF:

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### Overview
- **IAM**: Global service for managing access to AWS services and resources securely.
- **Root Account**: Created by default, should not be used or shared.

#### IAM Users and Groups
- **Users**: Individuals within your organization.
- **Groups**: Collections of users. Groups can only contain users, not other groups. Users can belong to multiple groups.

#### IAM Policies
- **Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions.
  - Follow the principle of least privilege: only grant the permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks.
  - Example policy structure:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
                "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
                "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                    "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                    "cloudwatch:Describe*"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

#### IAM Roles
- **Roles**: Allow AWS services to perform actions on your behalf.
  - Common roles: EC2 instance roles, Lambda function roles, Roles for CloudFormation.
  
#### IAM Security Tools
- **IAM Credentials Report**: Account-level report listing all users and the status of their credentials.
- **IAM Access Advisor**: Shows service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.

#### Advanced Identity Management
- **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**: Create temporary, limited-privilege credentials for accessing AWS resources.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides identity for web and mobile applications' users.
- **AWS Directory Services**: Integrates Microsoft Active Directory into AWS.
  - **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**: Fully managed AD service within AWS.
  - **AD Connector**: Directory gateway to redirect to on-premise AD.
  - **Simple AD**: AD-compatible managed directory on AWS.

#### IAM Identity Center
- **Successor to AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)**
  - Single sign-on for AWS accounts and business cloud applications (e.g., Salesforce, Box, Microsoft 365).
  - Supports SAML 2.0-enabled applications and EC2 Windows Instances.

This cheat sheet covers the essential components of IAM, including user and group management, policy application, roles, security tools, and advanced identity services provided by AWS. For more detailed information, refer to the IAM section in the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner guide .

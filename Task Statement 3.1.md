| **Deciding between access options**            | Understanding when to use programmatic access (APIs, SDKs, CLI), the AWS Management Console, or Infrastructure as Code (IaC)                          | **Programmatic Access**: Automates tasks, integrates with apps<br>**Management Console**: User-friendly, visual interface<br>**IaC**: Automates infrastructure provisioning and management using code | **Programmatic Access**: Automated deployments, CI/CD<br>**Management Console**: Initial setup, monitoring<br>**IaC**: Consistent and repeatable environments, version control |
| **Evaluating requirements for operations**     | Deciding whether to use one-time operations or repeatable processes based on the requirements                                                         | **One-time Operations**: Suitable for ad-hoc tasks, manual configurations<br>**Repeatable Processes**: Ensures consistency, uses automation and scripting | **One-time Operations**: Quick fixes, temporary changes<br>**Repeatable Processes**: Large-scale deployments, regular updates, backups |
| **Identifying deployment models**              | Understanding the different cloud deployment models: cloud, hybrid, on-premises                                                                       | **Cloud**: Fully hosted by cloud provider, scalable, cost-effective<br>**Hybrid**: Combines cloud and on-premises, flexible<br>**On-premises**: Local data centers, control, and security | **Cloud**: Startups, web applications<br>**Hybrid**: Financial institutions, data residency<br>**On-premises**: Legacy systems, compliance-heavy industries |
| **Identifying connectivity options**           | Recognizing different connectivity options: AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, public internet                                                             | **AWS VPN**: Secure, encrypted connection over the internet<br>**AWS Direct Connect**: Dedicated, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection<br>**Public Internet**: General access, less secure | **AWS VPN**: Secure remote access, extending on-premises networks<br>**AWS Direct Connect**: Data-intensive applications, hybrid cloud<br>**Public Internet**: General access, low sensitivity applications |

### Summary

- **Deciding between access options**: Choose programmatic access for automation, AWS Management Console for user-friendly interaction, and IaC for repeatable infrastructure management.
- **Evaluating requirements for operations**: Use one-time operations for quick, temporary tasks and repeatable processes for consistent, large-scale operations.
- **Identifying deployment models**: Select cloud for scalability and cost-efficiency, hybrid for flexibility and compliance, and on-premises for maximum control and security.
- **Identifying connectivity options**: Opt for AWS VPN for secure internet connections, AWS Direct Connect for high-performance and secure dedicated connections, and public internet for general, low-sensitivity access.

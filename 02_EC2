### Amazon EC2 Cheat Sheet

#### Overview
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering from AWS, allowing you to rent virtual machines and storage, distribute load, and scale using auto-scaling groups.

#### Key Features
- **Rent Virtual Machines**: Known as EC2 instances.
- **Storage Options**: Elastic Block Store (EBS) for virtual drives.
- **Load Balancing**: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Auto-scaling groups (ASG) to manage scaling.

#### EC2 Sizing & Configuration
- **Operating System**: Linux, Windows, or Mac OS.
- **Compute Power & Cores**: Customize the CPU.
- **Memory**: Select the amount of RAM.
- **Storage Space**: 
  - **EBS**: Network-attached storage.
  - **Instance Store**: Physical hardware storage.
- **Network**: Speed, Public IP address, and security group configurations.
- **Bootstrap Script**: EC2 User Data to run initial setup commands.

#### EC2 User Data
- **Bootstrapping**: Automate tasks at startup (e.g., installing updates, software, downloading files).
- **Runs as Root**: Only executes once at the first launch of the instance.

#### Launching an EC2 Instance
- **AWS Console**: Use to launch virtual servers, configure parameters, and manage instances (start/stop/terminate).

#### EC2 Instance Connectivity
- **SSH Access**: Securely connect to your instance using SSH (Windows users can use Putty).
- **EC2 Instance Connect**: Connect via browser without a key file (only for Amazon Linux 2).

#### EC2 Instance Purchasing Options
- **On-Demand**: Pay by the second or hour without upfront cost.
- **Reserved Instances**: Up to 72% discount for 1 or 3-year commitments, with flexible payment options.
- **Savings Plans**: Commit to usage amount for 1 or 3 years, flexible across instance families.
- **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused capacity with potential savings, but instances can be terminated anytime.
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical servers for isolated workloads.
- **Dedicated Instances**: Instances on hardware dedicated to a single customer.
- **Capacity Reservations**: Reserve capacity within an Availability Zone.

#### Storage Options
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Network-attached storage volumes.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)**: Managed NFS for Linux instances, scalable and multi-AZ.
- **Instance Store**: Temporary storage on physical disks attached to the host machine.
- **FSx**: Managed 3rd party file systems (e.g., Lustre, Windows File Server, NetApp ONTAP).

#### Best Practices
- **Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads**: Ensure cost savings over time.
- **On-Demand Instances for flexibility**: Ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads.
- **Spot Instances for cost savings on interruptible workloads**: Take advantage of spare capacity pricing.
- **Secure your instances**: Configure security groups and use SSH keys for secure access.
- **Automate with EC2 User Data**: Set up instances automatically at launch.
